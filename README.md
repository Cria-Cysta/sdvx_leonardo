Arduino Leonardo code to make a Sound Voltex Controller

#INTRODUCTION
Sound Voltex is a rhythm game created by Konami. Since it is an arcade game, there are no official controllers and no offical way to play at home. There is a similation of this game called K-Shoot. Since we would want to play the game as if it was an arcade game, we will need to create a controller to play the game. This is to create a Sound Voltex controller using an Arduino Leonardo. It will take 7 buttons and 2 rotary encoders. Using this, we will maps the controls so that it will act as a keyboard and mouse plugged into the computer. Then, we can use this to play Sound Voltex/K-Shoot.
